Fix the OTP verification issue in src/pages/CandidateLoginPage.jsx. The problem is that when users enter the OTP and click verify, it gets stuck on "checking" and eventually times out.

ISSUES TO FIX:
1. Add loading state (isVerifying) to show verification progress
2. Add 30-second timeout to prevent infinite hanging
3. Disable submit button during verification to prevent multiple clicks
4. Show loading spinner/text ("Verifying...") on button during verification
5. Improve error handling with clear, user-friendly messages
6. Clear OTP input on error so user can retry
7. Properly await profile creation after OTP verification
8. Handle session establishment with retry logic if session not immediately available

REQUIREMENTS:
- Add useState for isVerifying loading state
- Wrap verifyOtp call in Promise.race with 30-second timeout
- Update submit button to show loading state and disable when isVerifying is true
- Add proper error messages for timeout, invalid token, and other errors
- Ensure profile is created/updated after successful OTP verification
- Navigate to /dashboard only after session is confirmed
- Clear OTP array on error: setOtp(['', '', '', '', '', ''])

The function handleSignupVerification (starting around line 86) needs to be completely rewritten with these improvements. The button around line 315 also needs to be updated to show loading state.

Make sure the code handles:
- OTP verification with timeout
- Profile creation with upsert
- Session establishment with fallback retry
- Clear error messages
- Loading states
- Button disabled state during verification

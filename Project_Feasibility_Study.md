# PROJECT FEASIBILITY STUDY

## INTERNATIONAL JOB RECRUITMENT PORTAL

| Feasibility Criteria | Weight (Percentage) |
| :--- | :---: |
| **6.1.1 Operational Feasibility:**<br><br>This system is highly operationally feasible as it directly addresses the critical need for a centralized, transparent platform for international recruitment.<br><br>**Candidate Benefit:** Candidates gain a unified interface to upload documents (Passport, PCC, Resume) and track application status in real-time. The dashboard eliminates manual follow-ups by providing instant status visibility.<br><br>**Organization Benefit:** The "3-User Architecture" (Admin/Recruiter/Candidate) streamlines the vetting process using standardized profiles. Automated role-based routing ensures smooth data flow without manual intervention. | **30 %** |
| **6.1.2 Technical Feasibility:**<br><br>The project relies on the robust, open-source MERN stack, ensuring high scalability and control:<br><br>**Frontend Maturity:**<br>• **React + JavaScript (ES6+):** Ensures rapid development with a flexible component model.<br>• **Vite:** Provides faster build times than traditional bundlers.<br>• **Tailwind CSS:** Enables rapid, responsive UI development.<br><br>**Backend & Database Reliability:**<br>• **Node.js & Express:** Lightweight, non-blocking I/O ideal for handling concurrent requests.<br>• **MongoDB Atlas:** Scalable NoSQL cloud database for flexible data modeling.<br>• **GridFS Storage:** Secure, integrated file storage for handling large resumes and documents directly in the database. | **30 %** |
| **6.1.3 Economic Feasibility:**<br><br>**Cost to Develop:** Development costs are minimal as the entire stack is open-source.<br><br>**Infrastructure Savings:**<br>• **Fullstack JavaScript:** Reduces resource costs by unifying Frontend and Backend languages.<br>• **Free Tier Hosting:** MongoDB Atlas (Database) and Vercel/Render (App Hosting) offer generous free tiers.<br><br>**ROI:** The platform automates manual agency tasks, reducing labor costs and turnover time. | **20 %** |
| **6.1.4 Schedule Feasibility:**<br><br>The project is feasible within the 8-week timeline due to parallel task allocation.<br><br>**Timeline Overview:**<br>• **Reqs & Design:** Week 1-2<br>• **Development (MERN Stack):** Week 3-5<br>• **Integration & Testing:** Week 6-7<br>• **Deployment:** Week 8<br><br>**Risk Mitigation:**<br>• **Unified Language:** Using JavaScript across the stack speeds up development.<br>• **Libraries:** Using proven libraries like Mongoose and Multer reduces custom coding effort. | **20 %** |
